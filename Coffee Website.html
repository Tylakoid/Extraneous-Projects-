<h1 id="how-to-make-an-espresso"> How to make an espresso? </h1>
<p>An espresso is one of the most simplest coffees on the menu. <br>
One shot of espresso should contain <em>30ml</em>, but it can vary depending on whether a person wants a strong or weak coffee. When measuring the amount of coffee beans we should add, place you thumb on the centre of the machine and hold the lever and pull.<br>
Once you have completed measuring the amount of coffee beans, make sure to press down the coffee beans with <em>18kg</em> of weight, then proceed to carefully tighten it on to the coffee machine and press the button for <em>30mls</em> of water. <br>
The coffee should have a nice brown colour and <strong>CREMA</strong>!!!</p>

<h2>Do you know what days are the best to enjoy coffee?</h2>
<p>The answer's simple. Rainy days where you can snug on your sofa and prepare your<strong>OWN coffee</strong>. Not the <em>boring old instant coffee</em>, but coffee with <strong>real</strong> flavour and creaminess, and better yet,<em>you can do it from the comfort of your own home</em>! What better way is there to spend winter? Especially if you, like me, don't want to walk outside of the house. Of course we aren't encouraging isolation, but self-care. Coffee can be made for your friends and family, if you ever see someone tired or upset, offer them a warm cup of coffee. </p>

<p> Now to prepare yourself to make coffee you're going to need a couple of items.</p>
<h2>Items for your first coffee:</h2>
<ol>
  <li> First and foremost, a coffee machine.</li>
    <li> A grinder, to grind your coffee beans!</li>
      <li> coffee beans of course!</li>
        <li>A tamper, to pack the grinded coffee beans.</li>
          <li>Cleaning agents to clean the coffee machine.</li>
            <li> Last, but not least, a jug to froth the milk in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, with all our ingredients, let's start grinding those coffee beans and leaving the coffee machine on 15 minutes before using it!</p>
<h1><strong>Enjoy!</strong></h1>
